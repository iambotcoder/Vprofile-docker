## üîë Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- A terminal or command prompt with administrative privileges

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture
This project utilizes Vagrant to set up an **Ubuntu virtual machine** with the following configurations:

- **Base OS:** Ubuntu Jammy 64-bit
- **Networking:**
  - Private network with a static IP (`192.168.56.14`)
  - Public network for external access
- **Resource Allocation:**
  - Memory: 1600MB
  - CPUs: 2
- **Synced Folder:**
  - Maps `D:\scripts\shellscripts` on the host to `/opt/scripts` in the VM
- **Provisioning (Optional):**
  - Can be configured to install packages (like Apache) automatically

### Workflow:
1. **Initialize Vagrant** ‚Äì Create the required configuration.
2. **Start the VM** ‚Äì Boot the virtual machine.
3. **Access the VM** ‚Äì SSH into the machine.
4. **Validate Network Settings** ‚Äì Check assigned IPs.
5. **Destroy the VM** ‚Äì Cleanup once testing is complete.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation
### 1‚É£ Initialize Vagrant:
```bash
vagrant init
```

---

## üêæ Vagrant Setup üñ•Ô∏è

Below is the `Vagrantfile` configuration used for this project:

```ruby
# -- mode: ruby --
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
# you're doing.
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
  # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com.

  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://vagrantcloud.com/search.
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/jammy64"

  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
  # config.vm.box_check_update = false

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine and only allow access
  # via 127.0.0.1 to disable public access
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
   config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.82"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
   config.vm.network "public_network"

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  # config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
   config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
     vb.memory = "2048"
   end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Keep the default insecure SSH key
  config.ssh.insert_key = false

  # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
  # Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet and Salt are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
   config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
   sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg -y

sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.1.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   SHELL
end
```

### 2‚É£ Start the Virtual Machine:
```bash
vagrant up
```

### 3‚É£ Check VM Status:
```bash
vagrant status
```

### 4‚É£ SSH into the VM:
```bash
vagrant ssh
```

### 5‚É£ Check Network Configuration:
```bash
ip addr show
```

### 6‚É£ Exit the VM:
```bash
exit
```

## üê≥ Docker Setup

### 1‚É£ **Install Docker inside the VM**:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
```

### 2‚É£ **Verify Docker Installation**:
```bash
docker --version
```

### 3‚É£ **Run a Test Container**:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

### 4‚É£ **Docker Compose Setup**:
Install Docker Compose inside the VM if it's not already installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
```

### 5‚É£ **Create a `docker-compose.yml` File**:
In your VM, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  vprodb:
    image: vprofile/vprofiledb
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - vprodbdata:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=vprodbpass

  vprocache01:
    image: memcached
    ports:
      - "11211:11211"

  vpromq01:
    image: rabbitmq
    ports:
      - "15672:15672"
    environment:
      - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=guest
      - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=guest

  vproapp:
    image: vprofile/vprofileapp
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - vproappdata:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps

  vproweb:
    image: vprofile/vprofileweb
    ports:
      - "80:80"

volumes:
  vprodbdata: {}
  vproappdata: {}
```

### 6‚É£ **Start Docker Compose Services**:
Navigate to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located, then run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 7‚É£ **Verify Running Containers**:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### 8‚É£ **Stop Docker Compose Services**:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## üßπ Cleaning Up Resources

To remove the VM and free up system resources, run the following commands in order:

### 1‚É£ Destroy the Virtual Machine:
```bash
vagrant destroy
```

### 2‚É£ Remove Unused Vagrant Instances:
```bash
vagrant global-status --prune
```
